# Compensation & development

In this section, we outline our guidelines for compensating employees according to their employment status. We also describe our performance management and employee development policies.

## Compensation status

There are two types of employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) guidelines:

1. Non-exempt employees, who are covered by the FLSA’s minimum wage and overtime provisions.

2. Exempt employees, who aren’t covered by the FLSA because they meet three exemption criteria: (a) they are paid at least $23,600 per year ($455 per week), (b) they are paid on a salary basis, and (c) they perform exempt job duties (“executive,” “professional,” and “administrative”). Most employees must meet all three criteria to be exempt.

If you are unsure as to whether you should be exempt or not, please ask HR to clarify your status.

The FLSA excludes some types of jobs (e.g. railroad workers, truck drivers) because they are covered by other federal laws. Some other workers, like outside salespeople, are excluded by definition. Feel free to ask us for clarifications any time.

## Overtime

We will always do our best to ensure overtime is not needed by planning and executing projects effectively. Overworking and burnout are rarely worth it. However, if we can't avoid it, it is important to know:

- Exempt employees are not entitled to overtime pay by federal law. 
- Non-exempt employees are entitled to overtime pay of one and a half times your wage. 

## Payroll

We pay your salary or wage every 15th and end of month via direct deposit through our payroll provider Gusto.

## Performance management

We have built our performance management practices to:

- Ensure you understand your job responsibilities and have specific goals to meet.
- Provide you with actionable and timely feedback on your work.
- Invest in development opportunities that help you grow professionally.
- Recognize and reward your work in financial or non-financial ways (e.g. employee awards.)

### Objectives

Our collective objectives include the impact of our work, the financial performance of the company, and the well being of our people. We believe we can be a profitable, impactful, and successful company while being a great place for all of us. Therefore, we will be open and transparent regarding individual objectives necessary to meet our collective goals. 

We anticipate every employee will have goals regarding billable work and non-billable internal work. These goals, as well as how we arrived at them, will be discussed, communicated regularly, and continually re-evaluated. 

### Feedback 

We believe in an open feedback model. We encourage you to give us timely feedback any time it may be relevant and will do the same with you. We do not believe in scheduled performance reviews or overbearing performance review processes.

## Career growth

We believe it is imperative that our team never stops learning. Technology is a wide and diverse field and there are many opportunities for growth. If there is a specific conference, speaking opportunity, meetup, training class, certification, or other career advancement element you would like to be involved in, please ask us about it. We can't guarantee we can fund all of your requests, but we will do our best if it aligns with our mission and goals.
