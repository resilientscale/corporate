# Code of conduct

As an employee, you are responsible for behaving appropriately at work. We outline our expectations here. We can’t cover every single case of conduct, but we trust you to always use your best judgement. Reach out if you face any issues or have any questions.

## Cyber security and digital devices

This section deals with all things digital at work. We want to set some guidelines for using computers, phones, our internet connection, and social media to ensure security and protect our assets.

You must not use company assets and/or information systems to:

- Download or upload obscene, offensive, or illegal material.
- Send confidential information to unauthorized recipients.
- Invade another person’s privacy and gain access to sensitive information.
- Download or upload pirated movies, music, material, or software.
- Visit potentially dangerous websites that can compromise the safety of our network and computers.
- Perform unauthorized or illegal actions, like hacking, fraud, or buying/selling illegal goods.
- Send insulting or discriminatory messages and content.

### Corporate social media expectations

If you handle our social media accounts or speak on our company’s behalf, we expect you to protect our company’s image and reputation. Specifically, you should:

- Be respectful, polite, and patient.
- Avoid speaking on matters outside your field of expertise when possible.
- Follow our confidentiality and data protection policies and observe laws governing copyrights, trademarks, plagiarism, and fair use.
- Coordinate with our [PR/Marketing department] when you’re about to share any major-impact content.
- Avoid deleting or ignoring comments for no reason.
- Correct or remove any misleading or false content as quickly as possible.

## Conflict of interest

Conflicts of interest arise when your personal goals are no longer aligned with your responsibilities towards the company. For this reason, conflicts of interest are a serious issue for all of us. We expect you to be vigilant to spot circumstances that create conflicts of interest, either for yourself or your direct reports. Follow our policies and always act in our company’s best interests. If you are experiencing an ethical dilemma, talk to us and we will try to help you resolve it.

## Employee relationships

We want to ensure that relationships between employees are appropriate and harmonious. We outline our guidelines and we ask you to always behave professionally.

### Fraternization

Fraternization refers to dating or being friends with your colleagues. In this policy, “dating” equals consensual romantic relationships and sexual relations. Non-consensual relationships constitute sexual violence and we prohibit them explicitly.

#### Dating colleagues

If you start dating a colleague, we expect you to maintain professionalism and keep personal discussions outside of our workplace.

You are also obliged to respect your colleagues who date each other. We won’t tolerate sexual jokes, malicious gossip,or improper comments. If you witness this kind of behavior, please report it to HR.

#### Dating managers

To avoid accusations of favoritism, abuse of authority, and sexual harassment, supervisors must not date their direct reports. This restriction extends to every manager above an employee.

Also, if you act as a hiring manager, you aren’t allowed to hire your partner to your team. You can refer them for employment to other teams or departments where you don’t have any managerial or hiring authority.

#### Friendships at work

Employees who work together may naturally form friendships either in or outside of the workplace. We encourage this relationship between peers, as it can help you communicate and collaborate. However, we expect you to focus on your work and keep personal disputes outside of our workplace.

### Employment of relatives

Everyone in our company should be hired, recognized, or promoted because of their skills, character, and work ethic. We would not like to see phenomena of nepotism, favoritism, or conflicts of interest, so we will place some restrictions on hiring employees’ relatives.

To our company, a “relative” is someone who is related by blood or marriage within the third degree to an employee. This includes: parents, grandparents, in-laws, spouses or domestic partners, children, grandchildren, siblings, uncles, aunts, nieces, nephews, step-parents, step-children, and adopted children.
