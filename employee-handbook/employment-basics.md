# Employment basics

This section explains Resilient Scale's basic employment policies.

## Employment contract types

Full-time employees work at least 120 hours per month on average.

We remind you that, in the U.S., employment is “at-will.” This means that you or Resilient Scale may terminate our employment relationship at any time and for any non-discriminatory reason(s).

## Equal opportunity employment

Resilient Scale is an equal opportunity employer. We don’t tolerate discrimination against protected characteristics (gender, age, sexual orientation, race, nationality, ethnicity, religion, disability, veteran status.) We want all employees (including executives and HR) to treat others with respect and professionalism. In practice, this means that we:

- Hire and promote people based on creating an inclusive, diverse, and empowered workforce. 
- Value diversity and aim to reduce bias in every process.
- Make accommodations to help people with disabilities move about safely on our premises and use our products, services, and equipment.
- Use inclusive, diversity-sensitive language in all official documents, signs, and job ads.

Apart from those actions, we commit to penalizing every discriminatory, offensive, or inappropriate behavior. To do this properly, we ask you to report any discriminatory action against yourself or your colleagues to HR. Our company will not retaliate against you if you file a complaint or discrimination lawsuit. Any employee who retaliates or discriminates will face disciplinary action.

## Attendance

We expect you to be present during your scheduled working hours. Outside of emergencies, we should know when you won’t be coming in.
