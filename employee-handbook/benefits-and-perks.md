# Benefits and perks

In this section, we describe what we offer to our employees. We provide information on our health insurance plans and benefits, like work from home options and company-issued equipment.

## Employee health

The health of our employees and their families is very important to us. As a small business, we are not required by law to offer healthcare. However, we feel this is important basic human right and therefore intend to offer healthcare to all of our employees. 

We offer health care, vision, and dental coverage for employees and their dependents. For details on the plans including the amounts covered by Resilient Scale, see the benefits link in Gusto.

## Workers’ compensation

We strive to keep our workplace safe, but accidents may happen occasionally. Employees who are injured at work (by accident or disease) can receive wage replacement, medical care, and rehabilitation benefits according to workers’ compensation laws, when appropriate. Please inform us of your injury as soon as possible. Ask us for the forms that you need to file a claim or contact your state agency for workers’ compensation.

Our company has a workers’ compensation policy according to guidelines of the states we operate in (currently Colorado and Montana). 

Workers compensation information for the state of Colorado is available here: https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdle/dwc.

## Remote-first

We are a remote-first company and believe our employees can work successfully from wherever you chose to be. We strive to obtain remote-first contracts to minimize the travel requirements and costs as well as time away from your family and friends. 

However, you may be required to travel for:

- Meetings 
- Conferences
- Training
- Customer work 

While we do not care where you are working from, certain contracts may have core hour requirements.

## Employee expenses

We will reimburse employees for approved expenses related to the direct execution of your employment. All expenses, with receipts, are to be entered into Harvest. Reimbursements will be processed within two pay periods via direct deposit.

We require employees to use sound judgement when incurring expenses, particularly as related to travel. We expect employees to select cost-effective options, provided they do overly inconvenience our employees. If you are unsure whether a large expenditure is appropriate, please ask your manager before incurring the expense. 

Some contracts will have additional requirements regarding expenses which must be adhered to.

## Company-issued equipment

As an employee, you will receive a laptop and possibly other devices. Unless otherwise mentioned in your contract, any equipment we offer belongs to our company and you may not sell it or give it away. You are also responsible for keeping our equipment safe and in good condition. If your equipment breaks or malfunctions, let us know so we can arrange to get it repaired. 

### Theft and damage of company equipment

Our equipment is insured for theft and damage. We ask you to inform us as soon as possible if your equipment is stolen or damaged. We might be able to trace stolen devices. Please also file a theft statement (affidavit) with the police and submit a copy to us.

All new Apple products will also have an Apple Care policy. Devices and policies information is listed [here](https://github.com/resilientscale/resources/blob/master/equipment/README.md) for easy reference.

### Security of company-issued devices

We advise you to keep your company-issued computer, tablet, and cell phone secure. You can do this if you:

- Keep all devices password-protected.
- Always use multi-factor authentication for all devices and services that support it.
- Ensure you do not leave your devices unattended.
- Install security updates for browsers and other systems as soon as updates are available.
- Do not disable security software provided by the company, including anti-virus.
