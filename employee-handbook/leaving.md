# Leaving our company

In this section, we describe our procedures regarding resignation and termination of our employees. 

## Employment at-will

We remind you that in the U.S. employment is “at-will”. This means that you or our company may terminate our employment relationship at any time and for any non-discriminatory reason.

## Resignation

You resign when you voluntarily inform HR or your manager that you will stop working for our company. We also consider you resigned if you don’t come to work for five consecutive days without notice.

You are not obliged to give us advance notice before resigning. For efficiency’s sake, and to make sure our workplace runs smoothly, we ask that you give at least two weeks notice or more, if possible. The more notice we have,the better.

We accept verbal resignations, but we prefer that you submit a written and signed notice of resignation for our HR records. We will reply with an acceptance of resignation letter within two days. HR will inform your manager that you are resigning if you haven’t already done so. Whether you want to announce your resignation to your team is up to you,but we encourage you to be open.

### Forced resignation

You can resign anytime at your own free will and nobody should force you into resignation. Forcing someone into resigning (directly or indirectly) is constructive dismissal and we won’t tolerate it. Specifically, we prohibit employees from:

- Creating a hostile or unpleasant environment.
- Demanding or coaxing an employee to resign.
- Victimizing, harassing, or retaliating against an employee.
- Forcing an employee to resign by taking unofficial adverse actions (e.g. demotions, increased workload).

## Termination

Terminating an employee is always unpleasant but sometimes necessary. If that happens, we want to ensure we act lawfully and respectfully.

We may terminate an employee either for cause or without cause.

### For cause termination

For cause termination is justified when an employee breaches their contract, engages in illegal activities (e.g. embezzlement), disrupts our workplace (e.g. harasses colleagues), performs below acceptable standards, or causes damage or financial loss to our company.

### Termination without cause

Without cause termination refers to redundancies or layoffs that may be necessary if we cease some of our operations or re-assign job duties within teams. We will follow applicable laws regarding notice and payouts.
We may help employees who were terminated without cause to find work elsewhere, if possible.

### Wrongful dismissal

If you manage team members, avoid wrongful dismissal. When you terminate an employee for cause, we expect you to be certain you made the right choice and keep accurate performance and/or disciplinary records to support your decision.

## References

When we terminate employees, we may provide references for those who leave in good standing. This means that employees shouldn’t have been terminated for cause. If you are laid off, you may receive references. Please ask your manager.

If you resign, you may ask for references and your manager has a right to oblige or refuse.
