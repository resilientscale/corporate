# Policy overview

Our unlimited PTO (paid time off) policy aims to allow you take leave as needed and desired. We believe our employees need time to rest and enjoy themselves outside work. Putting a cap on this important time doesn’t help our effort to achieve high levels of employee satisfaction and productivity.

This policy is based on mutual trust between Resilient Scale and our employees. It gives employees opportunities to work or take time off as they see fit, as long as they keep fulfilling their duties. We believe together we can manage our need for profitability while enjoying our lives outside of work.

## Scope

This policy applies to full-time and part-time employees of the company.

## Policy details

Resilient Scale doesn’t limit the amount of PTO employees can take provided they are meeting their required duties and deliverables. However, **we do enforce a minimum time off level to ensure employees are taking sufficient time away from work**.

All employees will have to take a minimum of 15 days off each year. This is the minimum and we hope you will decide to take more. The goal is to help you avoid exhaustion and tunnel vision as it relates to billable hours and profit sharing. It can be easy to get caught up in our work, but it is important that we all step away at times. We believe that collectively we can meet our profitability goals and still have a great work/life balance. 

Employees do not accrue time off and Resilient Scale will not compensate for unused leave. We do believe not taking time off can compromise your performance and well-being. Hence, we reserve the right to enforce the minimum if needed.

This policy doesn’t interfere with legally established leaves like maternity and paternity leave. 

### Time off procedure

We believe we are all responsible and respectful people who can manage work obligations and personal time. As an employee, you are obliged to:

- Avoid abusing the policy and negatively impacting your job performance and the company.
- Communicate and coordinate with your team to ensure everyone takes leave. This includes supporting your teammates on projects so everyone can take leave.
- Plan to delegate, postpone, or otherwise manage projects that will be affected by time off.
- Give us as much notice as possible of upcoming time off. 
- Get approval for time off of a week or longer. This is intended to ensure we can sufficiently cover our obligations, not as a gating factor.  

We can consider rejecting time off requests if:

- Other team members with similar or complementary duties have already asked for leave during the same time.
- The time in question is too busy or includes an important deadline for the employee asking for leave.
- An employee appears to abuse the policy. Supervisors have to prove that this is the case, using leave data and presenting evidence of employees’ inadequate deliverables. 

We will never reject leave requests for any of the following reasons:

- To discipline employees.
- To force employees to fulfil duties that aren’t urgent.
- To approve leave for another employee who made a later request.

Neither list is exhaustive. Effective communication between team members and common sense is vital to make this policy work for everyone.

The company will review this policy annually and address any issues.

### Out of office notice

If you are going to be out of the office/unavailable, create a calendar entry in the corporate calendar. We ask that you be diligent about this so we can quickly see who is available and who is out of the office.
