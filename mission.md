# Mission

Resilient Scale aims to scale our customers' cloud-native and technical capabilities, resiliently. We do this by working collaboratively with our customers to solve problems and transfer knowledge. Our focus is on improving organizational efficiency through process and technology while improving their working environments. After all, we value, respect, and empathize with the employees of our customers.

## Our principles

Life is short and we spend a lot of time at work. It sounds cliche, but we all have one short life to live. Therefore, we value people above all else. Whether it is our people or our customers, we put people's well being, enjoyment, and success above all else. 

We do our best work when we care about our people, our customers, and our work. Therefore we prioritize:

- mutual respect
- self-care
- fair compensation
- open, honest communication and feedback
- inclusive and supportive environments
- embracing diverse backgrounds and perspectives
- empathy-based connections and recommendations
- winning work we feel good about
- doing what is right by our people and our customers
- saying "no" when appropriate

## Our vision

Our vision for Resilient Scale is to be the preeminent trusted partner for our customers while being a fantastic place to work. We believe our priorities allow us to best serve our customers by not just impacting their bottom line, but also making their organization a better place to work. We believe our priorities also make for a great place to work.

Above all else, we want to be known for being good people, good partners, and good technologists. 

## Our plan

The tech industry is ripe with people and companies looking for a big payday. Too many times, this comes at the expense of employee health, well-being, and compensation. As a company, we are disgusted by the discrepancy in pay between the executives and employees at most companies. We are disgusted by the lack of transparency and "buzzword core-values" aimed at employees but not executives and decision-makers. Resilient Scale will never be one of these companies.

We will grow while maintaining profitability and sharing our success with our employees. We achieve this by having a clear understanding of our costs and being careful and selective about the contracts we sign. Controlled, long term growth with a focus on profitability is our game.

### FAQ

* **What about equity and profit-sharing for employees?** 

 We plan to share our profits with employees through benefits and structured profit-sharing programs. We don't plan on sharing equity as these programs are often an accounting nightmare. They create false hope of a big payday. Our focus is on long term viability and growth.

 You can see this focus reflected in our current benefits offering. In the United States, companies of 50 employees or less do not have to offer healthcare (and most do not). However, we believe the well-being of our people is paramount. We offer high quality, platinum healthcare for all employees and dependents. 

 We anticipate that our next benefit will be a 401K plan with structured profit sharing. We plan to implement this in 2020.

* **Will you take outside funding?** 

 Unlikely. We believe strategic growth funded by profitability is the sustainable path. This approach yields the best possible path to wealth and well-being for all of our employees. We have no desire to become a unicorn.

* **Are you looking to be acquired?** 

 No. We believe we can be a long term company that remains a great place to work and does exceptional work, all while building employee wealth. Most acquisitions we have seen compromise would values and priorities.
